# 26 inch isn't dead:1998 Specialized Hardrock

## Introduction

Last autumn I felt the itch to start a new bike project. I enjoy having a project
during winter times, it makes me look forward to spring and riding bikes in the sun.
I'm not much of an offroad kinda guy. Even my gravel bike rarely sees any dirt except
during bikepacking. Moreover, in winter I even run slick tires on the Cinelli, so that
combined with fenders, it makes for a more comfortable road riding experience, especially
when commuting. Of course, that means that I have no bike to ride offroad during the winter months.
Et voila, I had a reason for yet another bike in the collection. Especially in Flanders,
offroad riding is big in winter. A lot of local bike clubs organize winter rides through
the sloppy mud in the cold and rain. It's a completely distinct cycling scene compared to
the road, and one that I really never did experience fully. This time, compared to my last build, the Giant CFR,
I wanted to keep the budget really tight, and sought to spend maximum 50-100 euro on a base frame/bike with
hopefully as many things still useable. Finally, I landed on a 1998 Specialized Hardrock with a Rockshox suspension fork,
for which I paid 50 euros.

## Concept

After a quick assessment of what I had in store, the frame still
seemed in really good condition, as did the bottom bracket (spinning freely without any coarse feeling or play!). The headset and fork suspension
felt quite stiff, so I hoped I would be able to save those with a deep clean and some fresh grease.
Brakes definitely needed new cables, but the calipers and levers all still seemed pretty OK. Drivetrain-wise
everything seemed seized and rusty AF, albeit a deep clean + new cables would have probably revived the old 3x9 drivetrain.
However, I was kinda set to upgrade the bike to a more "modern" MTB groupset, so I decided to ditch the old drivetrain
and front derailleur to convert the bike to a 1x. Basic MTB shifter and derailleurs are
apparently dirt cheap, so it seemed like a good idea to do it this way. I wanted to keep the crankset, as
the polished silver color still looked really good and hoped I would get away with a bodge 1x by just mounting the middle
ring to the crankset with a chain catcher. Nevertheless, changing to 1x also meant I would need new wheels, since the hub
on the old wheels couldn't take a modern 10 or 11 speed cassette. I didn't feel to bad about this, as the wheels were banged
up pretty hard and restoring them would have been quite the painful operation. Furthermore I would need a new saddle, pedals,
some grips, bottle cages, ... all in all it seemed pretty reasonable to build this thing into a fun mud-machine without breaking the bank.



## Stripping and building

Stripping the bike went reasonably smooth and fast. After spraying a good amount of WD-40 around the bolts,
all of them came loose pretty easy. The only thing that needed a bit (actually, a lot) of convincing to
get loose, was the fork. Finally, some not so gentle taps with a rubber mallet made the stubborn fork pop
out the frame. Both fork and headset bearings came out really rusty, but honestly looked quite fine after
cleaning them, so I figured it would be a safe bet to just re-grease and use them. To my surprise, the fork
only had one actual spring in one of the legs. Apparently this is normal for cheap-ass old suspension forks.

The build itself was a really pleasant experience. Having all cables external
and only one derailleur to set up really is a joy. I managed to find some decent
looking 26 inch rim brake wheels with a suitable hub and chose a Shimano 1x10
drivetrain. For tires I chose 2 inch Conti Crosskings, not so fast, but they should provide
ample of grip for muddy times. I'm also not quite sure about the tire clearance on this particular frame is, but figured
2 inch should be a safe bet. White outer cables were a must on this bike in my opinion and I also
think the blue grips look quite good. Silver bottle cages match the other silver components on the bike.
The only real hickup during the build, was that the 10 speed change didn't fit the original middle chainring.
So, I needed a 74 BCD chainring, ideally a narrow-wide one, but it was not easy finding one. Finally I ended up with
a 32T chainring from TA Specialites, originally meant as the inner chainring of 3x road drivetrain.
To compensate for the lack of a narrow-wide chainring, I decided to mount a chain catcher. That, in combination
with the clutched derailleur should prevent any chain dropping for most types of riding.


## The Ride

At the moment of writing I only did one "real" ride with this bike, a 73 km mixed surface loop
with a variety of non-technical dirt surfaces and asphalt. First things first, the bike is
definitely too small for me. I have to pull the seatpost all the way out (a few cm past the
min. insertion point) to get to saddle at a rideable height. This results in a quite aggressive
fit with my weight leaning quite forward, so yeah, not the most comfortable for really long or
technical rides, but on this ride, which was a good representation of intended use, it really was
not that bad. Next to size, the other big limitation is that the 32T front ring in combination with
the 26 inch wheels spins out really quick. It didn't annoy me on the dirt, but on some asphalt sections
going 28-30km/h had me spinning at a high cadence. Other than those two points, the bike is really
fun to ride though. Due to its small size and wheels it feels super nimble and aggressive to ride in
dirt and around corners. The handlebar is pretty small as well compared to modern MTBs, which make it
initially feel really nervous, but super fun at the same time. This is the kind of bike that takes you
back to being a kid and skidding around the rear wheel all the time. The derailleur shifts super snappy
and the brakes are really responsive as well. The headset does show some wear, so the steering can
feel a bit rough sometimes, but nothing too problematic. I might chance the headset later on in the
lifespan depending on how much I end up riding with this bike.

## Conclusion

It's safe to say I'm still not an offroad kinda guy. Since I build this bike up,
I only managed one offroad ride... Also, the Cinelli is back in gravel mode, so
I probably wont be using this bike a lot until autumn/fall, maybe it will see some
more filthy action than. Nevertheless, this project was a lot of fun, and even if
I only get a couple of rides out of this every year, it still was worth it! So, just like
the CFR, I'm keeping it for now, but might sell it later down the line if it really doesn't
get used enough and/or I need space and money for a new build.
