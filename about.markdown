# Hi!

I'm a guy from Belgium that found a passion in riding and
 messing with bikes. On this website I'll share my main bike builds and try to document them as good as possible. Next to bikes, I'm working in academia as a PhD student. Generally into science, tech, movies and music.

 My bike collection:
 * 2017 Giant TCR Advanced
 * 2021 Cinelli Zydeco
 * 1997 Giant CFR Pro Series
